# dictd_webserver
Dictionary webserver accessible using any web browser on mobile or desktop.

You must have dictd (dictionary server), dict (dictionary client) and some dictionary database installed as a prerequisite. 

This is similar to the command line client dict except it works on web browsers to search for the meaning of a word using text field input and a search button. The output clearly displays text in languages other than english such as hindi.
